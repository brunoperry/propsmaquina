3D Software Renderer Engine Demo. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine to try stuff around. See deploy for notes on how to make the final html file.

[Check it out](https://brunoperry.net/demoscene/propsmaquina/).

For further details, check this entry on [pouet](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=72468);



### Prerequisites

I only tested in Chrome, but I think it should work on any browser that supports a canvas element.

### Installing

Clone the repo and start a local server on your project root folder.

Example:

If you have php installed type this in terminal: `php -S localhost:8000`

If not, try installing a [server extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6swHiPtew) on your chrome browser.


## Trying stuff around

There is absolutely no documentation except for a few comments that wont make your life easier.
You should know the basics on how a 3d render engine works. May God guide you through this code...

While developing, load the "editor" (the main `index.html` file) and play around with `Maquina.js` and `PropsCamera.js` files, which is where everything happens.

## Deploy

I'm using uglifyjs to minimize the project into a single .js file (`build/pm.js`), and [this site](https://cssminifier.com/) to minify the final css (`build/styles_prod.css`).
Then I copy/paste everything into the build/index.html `<style>` and `<script>` tags.

## Built With

* Pure JavaScript
* [uglifyjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js-es6) - To generate the final js code.
* [FileSaver](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) and [jszip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip) - To save screen recordings.
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - For the 3d models.
* [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/) - For the graphics.
